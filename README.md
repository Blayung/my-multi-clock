# my-multi-clock
The code for my own electronic clock, that I'm already planning to add way more features to than just showing the time. You won't do much with it unless you make a circuit just like mine.

Used parts:
- An nodemcu v1.0
- An 20x4 lcd screen (I use a green backlight variant)
- An I2C module for the lcd screen
- A small switch/button
- A bunch of wires (you need to figure the wiring out on yourself)
- A single 100nFa capacitor
- A single 10000 ohms resistor
- A single 100 ohms resistor

I also make it on 2 small breadboards and I power it with a usb cable.
